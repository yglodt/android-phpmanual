This is an offline viewer for the PHP Manual implemented as Android app.

**Now available on the Android Market!**

After you install it, it will ask if you want to download the PHP Manual in a language of your choice. The download is a zip-file and is about 15MB in size. The files are actually downloaded from the "Downloads" area on this project page.

When the download is done, it will extract the files to the sdcard (/sdcard/php-manual folder) of your device. The total space occupied by the extracted html-files can reach 100MB.

The extraction takes around 20 minutes on a G1-style device. After the extraction of the zip-file is finished the app loads the PHP Manual in a WebView and you can read all of it offline.

This is the first release so bugs can be expected, and no responsibility can be taken for malfunction.

**Fixes in 1.0:**

_- Improve feedback while downloading_

_- Improve speed slightly by not refreshing the progressbar so frequently (while extracting the zip-file)_

_- View gets correctly restored when rotating screen (previously you were thrown back to the index file)_

_- No more fc when going back in certain circumstances_
